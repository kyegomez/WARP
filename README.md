# WARP

The "WARP: Warp Speed Protocol (Performance Enhancements) Commit Shorthand" can be structured to provide clarity and brevity in commit messages. Here's how the notation can be set up:

Format: `[TYPE OF CHANGE]-[MODULE]: [Brief Description]`



## Types of Changes
Note the types of changes are flexible, they can be of any of the following or any not listed here only if they are interpretable.
1. **FEAT**: Feature Addition
2. **BUGF**: Bug Fix
3. **REFA**: Refactoring
4. **DOCS**: Documentation
5. **TEST**: Testing
6. **PERF**: Performance Improvement
7. **DEPR**: Deprecation
8. **STYL**: Code Style
9. **CLEA**: Cleanup
10. **DEBG**: Debugging
11. **INIT**: Initial Commit
12. **MERG**: Merge
13. **CONF**: Configuration
14. **SECU**: Security Patch
15. **RELE**: Release

Each of these abbreviations corresponds to a common type of change that might be made in a codebase. When used as part of a commit message, they quickly convey the nature of the change. For example, a commit message could start with "FEAT: Add user authentication system" or "BUGF: Fix login page crash issue." This approach helps in quickly identifying the purpose of changes in the codebase.

## [Module] Specification in WASP
In the WASP (Warp Speed Protocol) for commit messages, accurately specifying the module, file, or function/class is crucial for clarity and traceability. This section outlines how users should denote these elements in their commit messages.

### Denoting Files, Modules, and Classes/Functions

#### 1. **File Specification**
   - **Format**: `File: [Filename.ext]`
   - **Example**: `File: login.js`
   - **Description**: Specify the exact file name, including its extension. This is particularly useful for commits that are limited to changes in a single file.

#### 2. **Module Specification**
   - **Format**: `Module: [ModuleName]`
   - **Example**: `Module: Authentication`
   - **Description**: Use a concise yet descriptive name for the module. The module name should correspond to a logical subdivision of the project, such as a feature set, service, or a major component.

#### 3. **Class/Function Specification**
   - **Format**: `Class: [ClassName]` or `Function: [FunctionName]`
   - **Example**: `Class: UserAuthenticator` or `Function: validateUser`
   - **Description**: When changes are specifically tied to a particular class or function, clearly name that entity. This level of detail is beneficial for changes that are confined to a specific part of the codebase, such as a method update or a class refactoring.

### Guidelines for Effective Module Specification

#### Consistency
- **Project-Wide Standards**: Establish and adhere to project-wide standards for naming modules, classes, and functions. Consistency in naming conventions enhances the readability and understandability of commit messages.

#### Clarity
- **Descriptive Names**: Choose names that clearly reflect the purpose or functionality of the module, class, or function. Avoid overly technical or cryptic names that may not be immediately understood by all team members.

#### Brevity
- **Concise Descriptions**: While clarity is essential, brevity should not be compromised. Aim for succinct names that convey the necessary information without being overly verbose.

#### Context
- **Provide Adequate Context**: When the change spans multiple files or modules, provide a general description instead of listing each file or module. For instance, use `Module: PaymentGateway` to denote extensive changes within the Payment Gateway module.

#### Special Cases
- **Handling Exceptions**: In cases where changes span across multiple unrelated files or modules, use `Multiple: Various Changes` or a similar notation. Provide further details in the commit description if necessary.

## Examples

1. **FEAT-[Module]**: New feature for [Module], e.g., "FEAT-Auth: Add biometric login."
2. **BUGF-[Module]**: Bug fix in [Module], e.g., "BUGF-UI: Resolve alignment issue in navbar."
3. **REFA-[Module]**: Refactor code in [Module], e.g., "REFA-DB: Optimize database queries."
4. **DOCS-[Module]**: Documentation changes for [Module], e.g., "DOCS-API: Update API usage guide."
5. **TEST-[Module]**: Adding or updating tests for [Module], e.g., "TEST-Security: Add CSRF tests."
6. **PERF-[Module]**: Performance improvements in [Module], e.g., "PERF-ImageProc: Enhance image processing speed."
7. **DEPR-[Module]**: Deprecate functionality in [Module], e.g., "DEPR-Payment: Deprecate old payment API."
8. **STYL-[Module]**: Code style changes in [Module], e.g., "STYL-Core: Apply new formatting rules."
9. **CLEA-[Module]**: Codebase cleanup for [Module], e.g., "CLEA-Utils: Remove unused utilities."
10. **DEBG-[Module]**: Debugging in [Module], e.g., "DEBG-Chat: Fix message sync issue."
11. **INIT-[Module]**: Initial commit for [Module], e.g., "INIT-Repo: Initial project setup."
12. **MERG-[Module]**: Merge branch in [Module], e.g., "MERG-Backend: Merge feature branch into main."
13. **CONF-[Module]**: Configuration changes in [Module], e.g., "CONF-Deploy: Update deployment settings."
14. **SECU-[Module]**: Security patches for [Module], e.g., "SECU-Login: Patch XSS vulnerability."
15. **RELE-[Module]**: Release-related tasks for [Module], e.g., "RELE-App: Release version 1.2.0."

This shorthand ensures that each commit message is concise yet informative, indicating the type of change, the specific module it affects, and a brief description of what the change entails. It's particularly useful for quickly understanding the context and impact of changes in a large and complex codebase.


## Best Practices for Using WASP

### Commit Message Clarity
- **Descriptive Yet Concise**: Commit messages should be clear and concise. Avoid vague descriptions; be specific about what the commit achieves.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent format across all commit messages. This consistency aids in readability and understanding, especially when reviewing historical changes.

### Collaborative Workflow
- **Team Understanding**: Ensure that the entire development team understands and agrees on the meaning of each type of change. This shared understanding is crucial for effective communication.
- **Review and Feedback**: Regularly review commit messages as a team. Use this as an opportunity to provide feedback and improve the protocol.

### Integration with Development Tools
- **Automated Checks**: If possible, integrate automated checks in your version control system to ensure that commit messages follow the WASP format.
- **Documentation**: Include a section in your project’s documentation that describes the WASP protocol and its usage. This is particularly useful for new team members.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Adoption Resistance
- **Challenge**: Resistance from team members who are accustomed to a different commit message format.
- **Solution**: Provide training and demonstrate the benefits of WASP. Encourage open discussion about the format to address concerns.

### Ambiguity in Types of Changes
- **Challenge**: Difficulty in categorizing some changes, leading to ambiguity.
- **Solution**: Create guidelines that help in categorizing complex changes. Allow for flexibility and use the most appropriate category that closely matches the nature of the change.

## Future Perspectives

### Evolution of WASP
- The protocol might evolve to include more types of changes or adapt to new development practices.
- Integration with AI and machine learning tools could provide suggestions for categorizing changes or even automate parts of the process.

### Broader Adoption
- As the benefits of WASP become more evident, its adoption across various software development teams could increase.
- It may also inspire similar protocols in other aspects of software engineering, beyond commit messages.

## Conclusion

WASP provides a structured and efficient way to manage commit messages in software development projects. By standardizing how changes are documented, it enhances clarity, improves communication among team members, and facilitates a better understanding of the project’s history. As with any protocol, its success depends on proper implementation, regular review, and willingness to adapt to changing needs.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding, implementing, and benefiting from the WASP protocol in your software development endeavors.
